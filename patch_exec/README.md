# Instructions

I've already forked this repository from [eric wieser](https://github.com/eric-wieser/build-with-input), it can be found [here](https://github.com/liberize/build-with-input).

Since the pull request hasn't been merged to the original repository, you can clone mine and checkout to `ST3` branch.

Or you can just throw these files to your `User` directory if you prefer less packages like I do.
