# Sublime Text Plugins

This repository is a collection of some small plugins i am using.

## List

* `patch_exec` patch exec module to make it possible to build with input, originally written by [eric wieser](https://github.com/eric-wieser/build-with-input), modified to support ST3.
* `copy_with_line_numbers` copy text with line numbers, may be useful sometimes.
* `toggle_user_setting` toggle some settings with hotkey, customizable.
* `sublime_imfix` fix input method for CJK users on linux, originally written by Cjacker Huang, slightly modified to fix a bug.
* `markdown_preview` convert markdown with `redcarpet` and preview it in browser.
* `color_scheme` my color scheme, modified from `Juicy`.

## How to use

In most cases, you can just copy files in each folder to your `Packages/User` folder. 

Follow the guide in `README.md` if it exists.
