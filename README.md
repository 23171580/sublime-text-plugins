# Sublime Text Plugins

This repository is a collection of some small plugins i am using.

## List

* `patch_exec` Patch exec module to make it possible to build with input. Originally written by [eric wieser](https://github.com/eric-wieser/build-with-input). Modified to support ST3.
* `copy_with_line_numbers` Copy text with line numbers. May be useful sometimes.
* `toggle_user_setting` Toggle some settings with hotkey.
* `sublime_imfix` Fix input method for CJK users on linux. Originally written by Cjacker Huang. Slightly modified to fix a bug.
* `markdown_preview` Convert markdown with `redcarpet` and preview it in browser.
* `color_scheme` My color scheme which is modified from `Juicy`.
* `filter_lines` Keep only the lines which include the selected string.
* `find_all_references` Find all references to the selected string in current file. The idea comes from notepad++.
* `open_in_browser_alt` Open current file in the specific browser.
* `select_rect_area` Select a rectangular area of a file. When I wrote this, I didn't realize it's already a built-in feature of sublime text.

## How to use

In most cases, you can just copy files in each folder to your `Packages/User` folder. 

Follow the guide in `README.md` if it exists.
